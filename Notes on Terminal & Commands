- Access to ssh: ssh jkil@lxplus.cern.ch

- Some directories and their memories
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/  --> This is 5 GB storage maximum, so I should use it only for keeping code and text files
  - /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> I have 1 TB space here (I can do "ls /eos/user/j/jkil/" to check that it works)

- Some notes on privacy:
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/public/ --> Everybody on CERN has access
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/private/ and /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> Only I have access

- Commands in code (enter using "vi" command):
  - "/" command enables the search function
    - "n" command moves to the next entry of the search
    
- Installing ROOT:
  i) pushd /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/CMSSW_10_6_20/src/
    - "pushd" command moves to the directory specified, while remembering the diretory that I am currently in.
  ii) cmsenv
    - This means to load all libraries used by CMS. This command only works in src folder.
  iii) pushd
    - This command brings me back to the original directory that I was in.
