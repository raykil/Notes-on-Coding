- Access to ssh: ssh jkil@lxplus.cern.ch

- Some directories and their memories
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/  --> This is 5 GB storage maximum, so I should use it only for keeping code and text files
  - /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> I have 1 TB space here (I can do "ls /eos/user/j/jkil/" to check that it works)

- Some notes on privacy:
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/public/ --> Everybody on CERN has access
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/private/ and /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> Only I have access

- Commands in code (enter using "vi" command):
  - "/" command enables the search function
    - "n" command moves to the next entry of the search

- Commnands for Terminal
  - "ls -ltr" command gives info of all the files that are in the current directory (such as the time that the file was created.)
  - How to copy a file from LXPLUS to my local machine:
    - scp "jkil@lxplus.cern.ch:/eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/output_graphs/{filename}" .
      - the last "." means the current directory I am in.

- Installing ROOT:
  i) pushd /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/CMSSW_10_6_20/src/
    - "pushd" command moves to the directory specified, while remembering the diretory that I am currently in.
  ii) cmsenv
    - This means to load all libraries used by CMS. This command only works in src folder.
  iii) pushd
    - This command brings me back to the original directory that I was in.


<< git commands >>

- How to get a changed file on GitHub to my locale:
  - use "git fetch me" command

- How to commit in my local Terminal:
  i) Change the code that I want to change
  ii) use "git add {filename}" command to specify which files I want to commit.
  iii) use "git commit" command to commit the added files.
  
- "git merge me/master"
  - "me" in the command is name of my locale
- "git status" command tells me which things are changed
- "git remote -v" command tells me the locations where same(locally edited) copies are
