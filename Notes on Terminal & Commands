- Access to ssh: ssh jkil@lxplus.cern.ch

- Some directories and their memories
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/  --> This is 5 GB storage maximum, so I should use it only for keeping code and text files
  - /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> I have 1 TB space here (I can do "ls /eos/user/j/jkil/" to check that it works)

- Some notes on privacy:
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/public/ --> Everybody on CERN has access
  - /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jkil/private/ and /eos/user/j/jkil/ --> Only I have access
