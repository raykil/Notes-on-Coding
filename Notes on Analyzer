- How to plot things:

  1. Add information about what I want to plot in the analyzer
    - Analyzer is found here: /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/SUEPCoffea_dask/workflows/SUEP_coffea_ZH_simple.py
    - Information is in form of "out["leadlep_pt"] = leptons.pt[:,0]"
  
  2. Run the analyzer for signal and background using "condor_SUEP_WS.py"
    i) I need to activate coffea by typing "conda activate coffea"
    ii) To run the analyzer, type the following codes in "SUEPCoffea_dask" directory (which is a directory that contains "condor_SUEP_WS.py"):
      - For DY process: "python condor_SUEP_WS.py --isMC=1 --era=2018 --dataset=DY --analyzer=ZH_simple --infile=/eos/user/c/cericeci/SUEP_signals/DY18/NANO_NANO.root"
        - DY(Drell-Yann) process is the background. The code above makes a "condor_out.hdf5" file in "outputDY" directory.
      - For ZH procvess: "python condor_SUEP_WS.py --isMC=1 --era=2018 --dataset=signal --analyzer=ZH_simple --infile=/eos/user/c/cericeci/SUEP_signals/UL18/ZHleptonicpythia_generic_M125_T2ZHleptonic/NANOAOD/total.root"
        - ZH process is the signal. The code above makes a "condor_out.hdf5" file in "outputZH" directory.
    iii) A file "condor_out.hdf5" will be created in "SUEPCoffea_dask" directory. I have to move that file into respective directories, 
         i.e., "outputDY" and "outputZH" directories.
        
  3. Add new information in the plotter so that I can get a new plot
    - Plotter is found here: "/eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/SUEPCoffea_dask/plotting/doPlots.py"
    - To add new information: 
      i) Open "doPlots.py" using "vi doPlots.py" command
      ii) In line 14, there is code called "plots = {}". In {}, put info about the plots that I want to plot in the form:
          " "Leading Lepton phi":["leadlep_phi",50,0,6.28,"phi"] "
          - The first number (50 in this case) means the number of bins
  
  4. Make new plots by writing the following command: 
    - "python doPlots.py"
      -
