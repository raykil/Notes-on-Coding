*** Whatever I change the code, let's change in GitHub then pull it to my local Terminal.
  - How to pull
    i) Edit the thing that I want to edit in GitHub
    ii) Commit the changes
    iii) at Terminal "SUEPCoffea_dask" directory, write "git pull" command.

- SUEP coffea dask address: cd /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/SUEPCoffea_dask
- My personal website: https://raymondkil.web.cern.ch

- Installing ROOT:
  i) pushd /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/CMSSW_10_6_20/src/
    - "pushd" command moves to the directory specified, while remembering the diretory that I am currently in.
  ii) cmsenv
    - This means to load all libraries used by CMS. This command only works in src folder.
  iii) pushd
    - This command brings me back to the original directory that I was in.

- How to plot things:

  1. Add information about what I want to plot in the analyzer
    - Analyzer is found here: /eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/SUEPCoffea_dask/workflows/SUEP_coffea_ZH_simple.py
    - Information is in form of "out["leadlep_pt"] = leptons.pt[:,0]"
  
  2. Run the analyzer for signal and background using "condor_SUEP_WS.py"
    i) I need to activate coffea by typing "conda activate coffea"
    
    ii) To run the analyzer, type the following codes in "SUEPCoffea_dask" directory (which is a directory that contains "condor_SUEP_WS.py"):
      
      - For DY process: "python condor_SUEP_WS.py --isMC=1 --era=2018 --dataset=DY --analyzer=ZH_simple --infile=/eos/user/c/cericeci/SUEP_signals/DY18/NANO_NANO.root --outputdir=$PWD/outputDY"
        - DY(Drell-Yann) process is the background. The code above makes a "condor_out.hdf5" file in "outputDY" directory.
        - The last part of the command, i.e., "--outputdir=$PWD/outputDY", is commanding that the "condor_out.hdf5" to be in "$PWD/outputDY" directory
          - "$PWD/" is the trick to not write the whole address
      
      - For ZH procvess: "python condor_SUEP_WS.py --isMC=1 --era=2018 --dataset=signal --analyzer=ZH_simple --infile=/eos/user/c/cericeci/SUEP_signals/UL18/ZHleptonicpythia_generic_M125_T2ZHleptonic/NANOAOD/total.root --outputdir=$PWD/outputZH"
        - ZH process is the signal. The code above makes a "condor_out.hdf5" file in "outputZH" directory.
        - Like above, "--outputdir=$PWD/outputZH" part commands that the "condor_out.hdf5" to be in "$PWD/outputZH" directory
    
    iii) ***EDIT*** This part can be ignored becuase the code for analyzer is edited so that "out.hdf5" moves right into "outputDY" and "outputZH" folders.
         A file "condor_out.hdf5" will be created in "SUEPCoffea_dask" directory. I have to move that file into respective directories, 
         i.e., "outputDY" and "outputZH" directories.
        
  3. Add new information in the plotter so that I can get a new plot
    - Plotter is found here: "/eos/user/j/jkil/SUEP/SUEPCoffea_dask/plotting/doPlots.py"
    - How to add new information: 
      i) Open "doPlots.py" using "vi doPlots.py" command
      ii) In line 14, there is code called "plots = {}". In {}, put info about the plots that I want to plot in the form:
          - " "{Title of the plot}":["{Variable to be plotted}",{number of bins},{xmin},{xmax},"{Variable name}"] "
          - Ex) " "Leading Lepton phi":["leadlep_phi",50,0,6.28,"phi"] "
  
  4. Make new plots by writing the following command: 
    - First, make sure that I activated ROOT
    - "python doPlots.py"

- on submitJobs.py
  - calling the function takes 5 arguments: "python submitJobs.py {# of files} {folder where files to be processed are} {where to put output.hdf5 files} {queue to which it will submitted} {1}"
    - {# of files}: 10 is maximum, -1 means all
    - {queue to which it will submitted}: espresso
    - 1: this means 'do the submission'
